Arcee AI believes in a world in which every organization builds their own specialized AI on top of open source general intelligence, maintains ownership of their models, and leverages model merging to efficiently create the most accurate models. 
We’re making that world a reality with our end-to-end system for merging, training, and deploying Small Language Models (SLMs) that you own and that are adapted to your domain and data. Our solution is user-friendly and enables seamless deployment to any cloud or platform for inference.

Arcee.AI emerged from the brainstorming of three co-founders – Mark McQuade, Jacob Solawetz, & Brian Benedict – who envisioned a platform that would allow companies to use SLMs to fuel innovation while still retaining full control over their data and models. It was a vision based on deep knowledge of both the technical and business aspects of AI and machine learning, which they had gained via leading roles in companies including Hugging Face, Roboflow, and Tecton.
Upon Arcee.AI’s emergence from stealth in September 2023, the market immediately confirmed the need for their easy-to-use platform for creating performant and efficient custom LLMs, or what they call Small Language Models (SLMs). As they announced their Seed Round in January 2024, quickly followed by their Series A in July, they say what they're most proud of is seeing their expanding customer base empowered by Arcee.AI-built SLMs – which are driving business value and innovation for enterprises across the globe every day.
